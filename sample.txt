The Renaissance was a period of cultural, artistic, political, and economic rebirth following the Middle Ages. It began in Italy in the 14th century and spread throughout Europe, lasting until the 17th century. The Renaissance is characterized by a renewed interest in classical Greek and Roman culture, humanism, and significant developments in art, science, and literature.

Key figures of the Renaissance include Leonardo da Vinci, who exemplified the Renaissance ideal of a polymath - someone skilled in multiple disciplines. He was both an artist, creating masterpieces like the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, and a scientist, making detailed anatomical studies and engineering designs.

Michelangelo was another crucial figure, known for his sculptures like David and his painting of the Sistine Chapel ceiling. His work demonstrated the Renaissance emphasis on human anatomy and classical proportions.

The printing press, invented by Johannes Gutenberg around 1440, revolutionized the spread of knowledge during the Renaissance. This technology made books more accessible and affordable, leading to increased literacy and the rapid dissemination of new ideas.

Humanism was a central philosophical movement of the Renaissance, emphasizing the potential and worth of human beings. Humanists studied classical texts and promoted education in the liberal arts. This movement shifted focus from purely religious concerns to include secular subjects.

The Scientific Revolution also began during the Renaissance, with figures like Galileo Galilei and Nicolaus Copernicus challenging traditional views of the universe. Copernicus proposed the heliocentric model, placing the Sun at the center of the solar system rather than the Earth.
